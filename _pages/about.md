### About

Hello and welcome to my site!  I'm Alex Pandya, and I'm a computational physicist by training.  Most recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher in astrophysics at Cornell; before that I did my PhD in Physics at Princeton.  For more on my background, please see my <a href="https://aapandy2.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.

I've worked on a variety of projects whose topics range from the neuroscience of worm behavior to the interior structure of black holes and NBA roster construction.  For more details on these endeavors, please see my <a href="https://aapandy2.github.io/projects/">Projects</a> page.  

For a hyperlinked bibliography, please see my <a href="https://aapandy2.github.io/publications/">Publications</a> page.
