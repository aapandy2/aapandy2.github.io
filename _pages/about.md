### About

Hello, and welcome to my site!

I'm Alex Pandya, and I’m passionate about finding interdisciplinary solutions to challenging technical problems. Most recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://research.astro.cornell.edu/">Cornell Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science</a>, and before that, I completed my PhD in Physics at <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/">Princeton</a>.  For more on my background, please see my <a href="https://aapandy2.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.

Over the years I’ve worked on <a href="https://aapandy2.github.io/projects/">projects</a> spanning a variety of topics, including: non-equilibrium relativistic fluid mechanics, the interior structure of black holes, NBA roster construction, light emission from astrophysical plasmas, and the neuroscience of worm behavior. If you find any of these things interesting, I'd love to chat!  Feel free to contact me by email or on LinkedIn.

For a hyperlinked bibliography, please see my <a href="https://aapandy2.github.io/publications/">Publications</a> page.
