# Background

Fluids are materials that continuously deform (_flow_) when acted on by an external force.  Such materials are central to the human experience, which has no doubt been shaped by the flow of water (e.g. tides, ocean currents) and air (wind, storms).  As a result, modeling fluids has been a major goal of theoretical physics research for millenia.

A major surprise of modern physics is that the physical framework used to describe terrestrial fluids like water and air can also be used to describe exotic fluids like the matter composing stars and the extremely hot liquid formed in particle accelerator collisions.  In the latter cases, a couple of tweaks are necessary, however.  Specifically, one usually requires a fluid model which is compatible with relativity on top of the typical requirements that the model conserves energy/momentum and is consistent with the laws of thermodynamics.  The table below names four sets of fluid theories (by "theory" here we simply mean sets of equations) along with the physics they include.
